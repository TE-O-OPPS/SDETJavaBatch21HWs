# Traversing 2D Arrays with Loops

## Objective
Learn how to traverse and manipulate 2D arrays in Java using nested loops.

## Instructions

**Creating and Printing a 2D Array Using Loops**

In this exercise, you will write a program that creates a 2D array (matrix) and prints its elements using nested loops.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
   - Create a 2D array of integers with 4 rows and 3 columns.
   - Initialize the array with the following values:
     ```
     1  2  3
     4  5  6
     7  8  9
     10 11 12
     ```

2. **Print the 2D Array Elements Using Loops**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through the array.
   - Print each element in the array so that the output displays the array in matrix form.

## Expected Output
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
```
- **Printing Elements**:
   - Use `System.out.print()` to print elements in the same line.
   - Use `System.out.println()` to move to the next line after each row.

## Additional Information
- **2D Arrays**: A 2D array can be thought of as an array of arrays.
- **Nested Loops**: A loop inside another loop; used to traverse multi-dimensional arrays.

## Troubleshooting
- **Compilation Errors**:
   - Check for syntax errors like missing semicolons or braces.
   - Ensure that array indices are within bounds.

- **Incorrect Output**:
   - Verify that the loops correctly iterate over all rows and columns.
   - Ensure that you're not missing spaces or newlines in your output.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to traverse and manipulate 2D arrays using loops in Java. Happy coding!
