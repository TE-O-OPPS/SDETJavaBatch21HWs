# Extracting Specific Elements from a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to access and extract specific elements from a 2D array in Java using nested loops and conditional statements.

## Instructions

**Selecting and Printing Specific Elements from a 2D Array**

In this exercise, you will write a program that creates a 2D array and extracts elements that meet certain conditions.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array of integers with the following values:
      ```
      1  2  3  4
      5  6  7  8
      9 10 11 12
      ```

2. **Extract and Print Specific Elements**
    - Use nested loops to traverse the array.
    - Print only the elements that are even numbers.

## Expected Output
```
2
4
6
8
10
12
```
- **Printing Elements**:
    - Use `System.out.println()` to print each even number on a new line.

## Additional Information
- **2D Arrays**: A 2D array can be visualized as a table with rows and columns.
- **Nested Loops**: Loops inside loops are used to traverse multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Modulus Operator `%`**: Returns the remainder of a division operation. Useful for checking divisibility.

## Troubleshooting
- **Compilation Errors**:
    - Check for syntax errors like missing semicolons or braces.
    - Ensure that array indices are within bounds.

- **Incorrect Output**:
    - Verify that the loops correctly iterate over all rows and columns.
    - Ensure that the condition in your `if` statement correctly identifies even numbers.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to extract specific elements from a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
