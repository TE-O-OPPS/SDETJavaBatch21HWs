# Summing Rows in a 2D Array

## Objective
Learn how to work with 2D arrays in Java by calculating the sum of each row.

## Instructions

**Calculating the Sum of Each Row in a 2D Array**

In this exercise, you will write a program that creates a 2D array and calculates the sum of elements in each row.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the 2D Array**
    - Create a 2D array of integers with the following values:
      ```
      3  5  2
      1  4  7
      6  0  9
      ```

2. **Calculate and Print the Sum of Each Row**
    - Use nested loops to traverse the array.
    - For each row, calculate the sum of its elements.
    - Print the sum of each row on a new line in the format: `"Sum of row [row_number]: [sum]"`

## Expected Output
```
Sum of row 1: 10
Sum of row 2: 12
Sum of row 3: 15
```

## Tips
- **Traversing a 2D Array with Nested Loops**: Use one loop to iterate over the rows and another to iterate over the columns.
- **Calculating the Sum**: Initialize a sum variable for each row before the inner loop starts.
- **Printing Output**: Use `System.out.println()` to print the sum of each row.

## Additional Information
- **2D Arrays**: Think of a 2D array as a grid with rows and columns.
- **Nested Loops**: Used to navigate through multi-dimensional arrays.

## Troubleshooting
- **Compilation Errors**:
    - Ensure all loops and variables are properly declared and initialized.
    - Check that array indices are within the valid range.

- **Incorrect Output**:
    - Verify that the loops correctly iterate over all rows and columns.
    - Ensure that the sum is correctly calculated for each row.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to calculate the sum of each row in a 2D array in Java. Happy coding!
