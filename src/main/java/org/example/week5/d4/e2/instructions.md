# Extract Specific Values from an Array

## Objective
Learn how to use arrays and enhanced for loops in Java to extract and print specific values.

## Instructions

**Extract Specific Values from an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers and then uses an enhanced for loop to extract specific values based on a pattern.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
   - Create an array of integers with the values {45, 78, 12, 67, 55, 89, 23, 77, 88}.

2. **Extract and Print Specific Values Using an Enhanced For Loop**
   - Use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through the array and print the values that result in the output: 78, 55, 77.

## Expected Output
```
78 55 77
```

## Tips
- Use an `if` statement inside the enhanced for loop to check for the values you need to print.
- Remember that in an enhanced for loop, you work with the elements directly, not their indices.
- Ensure your loop processes all elements in the array.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for the enhanced for loop.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: An enhanced `for` loop simplifies the traversal of arrays and collections.
- **Loop**: A loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that your `if` condition inside the loop correctly identifies the values to print.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and enhanced for loops in Java. Happy coding!
