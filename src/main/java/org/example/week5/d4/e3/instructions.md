# Using Break in Loops

## Objective
Learn how to use the `break` keyword in Java loops, along with the enhanced for loop.

## Instructions

**Using Break in Loops**

In this project, you will write a small program that demonstrates the use of the `break` keyword within loops. You will create an array of integers and use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through the array, applying `break` under a certain condition.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
   - Create an array of integers with the values {12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90}.

2. **Iterate Through the Array Using an Enhanced For Loop**
   - Use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through the array.

3. **Use the `break` Keyword**
   - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is greater than 80.
   - If it is, use the `break` keyword to exit the loop.

4. **Print the Current Number**
   - For each number before the break condition is met, print the current number.

## Expected Output
```
12
23
34
45
56
67
78
```

## Tips
- **Using the Enhanced For Loop in Java**: Simplifies the traversal of arrays and collections.
- **Understanding the `break` Keyword in Loops**: The `break` statement exits the loop immediately.
- Be mindful of where you place the `break` statement to ensure the correct logic is applied.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect loop syntax.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that your `if` condition and the placement of `break` are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `break` keyword in Java loops. Happy coding!
