# Print Years using Enhanced For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to create and use arrays in Java to store and print a series of years using an enhanced for loop.

## Instructions

**Print Years Using an Array**

In this project, you will write a small program that creates an array of integers, stores the years from 2010 to 2020 using a `for` loop, and then prints all those values using an enhanced for loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Declare and Initialize the Array**
   - Create an array of integers with size 11.

2. **Add the Years to the Array Using a For Loop**
   - Use a `for` loop to add the years from 2010 to 2020 to the array.

3. **Print the Array Values Using an Enhanced For Loop**
   - Use an enhanced `for` loop to iterate through the array and print each value on a new line.

## Expected Output
```
2010
2011
2012
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
2020
```

## Tips
- Ensure your loops have the correct conditions to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for accessing array elements.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: In Java, an enhanced `for` loop (also known as a for-each loop) is used to traverse elements in arrays or collections.

## Additional Information
- **Array**: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.
- **Enhanced For Loop**: An enhanced `for` loop simplifies the traversal of arrays and collections.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect array declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop conditions and array access statements are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use arrays and enhanced for loops in Java. Happy coding!
