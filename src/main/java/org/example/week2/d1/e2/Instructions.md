# Java String Concatenation Exercise
## Objective
Learn how to create string variables and concatenate them in Java.
## Instructions
1. **Create Variables**
   - Declare the following string variables:
     ```java
     String language = "Java";
     String description = "programming language";
     String part1 = "syntax";
     String part2 = "techs.com";
     ```

2. **Print Values**
   - Concatenate the `language` and `description` variables to print the output:
     ```
     Java is the #1 programming language
     ```
   - Then concatenate the `part1` and `part2` variables to print the output:
     ```
     syntaxtechs.com
     ```

   Example code for both:
    ```java
    System.out.println(language + " is the #1 " + description);
    System.out.println(part1 + part2);
    ```

3. **Run Your Program**
   - Run your program to see the output of the concatenated strings.

## Expected Output
```
Java is the #1 programming language
syntaxtechs.com
```

## Tips
- Use `System.out.println` to print the concatenated strings on new lines.
- Ensure your variables are declared and assigned correctly.

## Additional Information
- **String Variables**: A String variable can hold text.
- **String Concatenation**: Use the `+` operator to concatenate (combine) strings.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the variables are assigned the correct values and printed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to concatenate strings in Java. Happy coding!
