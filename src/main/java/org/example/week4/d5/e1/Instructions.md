# Printing Even Numbers with a For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use a for loop in combination with an if condition to print even numbers within a specific range.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through numbers and an if condition to print only the even numbers from 2 to 14 (inclusive).

**For you to do:**

1. **Create a for loop**
    - Initialize the loop variable to start at 2.
    - Set the condition to continue the loop while the variable is less than or equal to 14.
    - Increment the loop variable by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Add an if condition inside the loop**
    - Check if the current number is even using the modulus operator (%).
    - If the number is even, print it to the console.

3. **Ensure 14 is included**
    - Make sure your loop condition includes 14 in the range.

## Example Output
```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
```

## Tips
- Remember that even numbers are divisible by 2 with no remainder.
- Use the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is even. For example, `number % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even.
- Ensure your loop condition is set to `<=` 14 to include 14 in the output.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect loop syntax.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that your if condition correctly identifies even numbers.
- If 14 is not included in the output, check your loop condition to make sure it includes 14 in the range.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use a for loop with an if condition to print even numbers within a specific range. Happy coding!
