// Hint 1: Declare and initialize your email string - think about a valid email format

// Hint 2: Remember index 0 gives you the first character of any string

// Hint 3: Use >= and <= with a-z and A-Z to check for letters, combine with OR (||)

// Hint 4: The 5th character is at index 4 (since counting starts at 0)

// Hint 5: Use == to compare characters
