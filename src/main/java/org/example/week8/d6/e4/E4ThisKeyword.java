        // Hint: In the `Dog` class, declare instance variables `dogName` and `dogWeight` as private, and `dogBreed` as a static variable with a default value of "Mutt".
// Hint: Create a constructor that accepts `dogName` and `dogWeight` as parameters and initializes the instance variables using these values.
// Hint: Use the `displayDetails` method to print the dog's name, breed, and weight in the format: "DogName DogBreed DogWeight".
// Hint: Remember, `dogBreed` is static, so it is shared across all `Dog` objects.
// Hint: In the `Main` class, create two `Dog` objects with different names and weights, then call `displayDetails` for each to print their details.
