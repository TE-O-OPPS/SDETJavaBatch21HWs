// Hint: In the third constructor, assign `"unknown"` as default values for `make` and `model` when they are not provided.
// Hint: In the fourth constructor, set `topSpeed` to 90 and `price` to 0 by default when they are not provided.
// Hint: Use the `display()` method to print all instance variables in the format: "make model numberOfDoors topSpeed price".
